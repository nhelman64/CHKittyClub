                <h2>The <span style="font-style:italic;">Compassionate Veterinarian Award</span></h2>
                <p>A primary focus of the CH Kitty Club members is seeing that kittens diagnosed with CH are not euthanized.&nbsp; We have seen hundreds of CH kitties survive, and even thrive, long into their teen years.&nbsp; They learn early to compensate for the some of their disabilities, while experiencing the love of human and feline families just as kitties which are not diagnosed with CH.</p>
                <p>To help spread the word that CH is not a death sentence, and to further enhance the services available to everyone who finds themselves blessed with a CH kitty, the CH Kitty Club is sponsoring an annual Compassionate Veterinarian Award.&nbsp; Members of the general population may nominate their veterinarian for the award, which consists of a formally awarded plaque the winner will be proud to display along with their professional credentials and a formal, world wide announcement to publicize the name of the winning veterinarian.&nbsp; Nominees answer a brief online questionnaire about their practice as it relates to CH kitties, and are then vetted and judged by a volunteer group of active members of the CH Kitty Club.&nbsp; This group of judges, comprised of people who live day in and day out with one or more CH kitties, then select a winner to receive the Compassionate Veterinarian Award.</p>
