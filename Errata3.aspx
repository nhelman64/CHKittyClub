            <h2>A Life</h2>
            <p>A poem submitted by Jessica</p>
            <div class="entry">
                <p>A baby is born, the miracle of birth</p>
                <p>Another treasure of the sea, a budding blossom of the earth.</p>
                <p>Whether a human, dog, or cat, what difference should it make?</p>
                <p>A family, heart, and soul, a complete life form it does take.</p>
                <p>So when you move on in the future, why even consider leaving it behind?</p>
                <p>Do you honestly believe it doens't notice, do you really think it doesn't mind?</p>
                <p>Fuzzy friends are not our toys, they aren't items for sale or for trade</p>
                <p>Not a car to be bargained, instead a life by better hands that has been made.</p>
                <p>Thrown out carelessly on the streets, like garbage or an empty food bag</p>
                <p>Brutal attacks on that so innocent is not a thing so proudly to brag.</p>
                <p>We take it out on those so small, we can't even face our own judgmental fears</p>
                <p>But all the blood and pain are all shed in those victim's tears.</p>
                <p>Make an important lifetime choice, adopt a pet to care for like your own child</p>
                <p>Whether born in warm, safe quarters or scrapping out in the cold, rugged wild.</p>
                <p>So many mouths crying in this world, spaying and neutering is the only key</p>
                <p>Only then can they be healthy and happy, only then secure and responsible can we be.</p>
                <p>After all, it's not just a fancy collectible car, not a replaceable utensil like a spoon, fork, or knife</p>
                <p>It's not just a matter of your own "convenience", it's the simple matter of a LIFE.</p>
